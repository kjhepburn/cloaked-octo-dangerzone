##Activity##
        Type of activity performed for which the measurements were taken
                LAYING
                SITTING
                STANDING
                WALKING
                WALKING UPSTAIRS
                WALKING DOWNSTAIRS

##Subject##
        Identifier of study participant
                Integer 1-30

##For each following variables, the data are the means of original variable grouped by activity and subject. The following holds true for interpreting the variables' names:
        time = measurement in time
        FastFourier = measurement transformed by Fast Fourier Transformation
        BodyAcceleration = body linear acceleration
        GravityAcceleration = gravity acceleration
        Jerk = indicates jerk signal derived from body linear and angular acceleration
        mean = indicates that original variable was a mean of a sample of signals*
        StandardDeviation = indicates that original variable was a standard deviation of said signal               sample*
        *These variables are, respectively, a mean of many means and a mean of many standard deviations</table
